# GA Project 1 - Wordle Clone
*GA Project 1 - Wordle Project*

## Codename: **RIDDLE**
This is my first completed project of a [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) clone that I built *(semi)* from the ground up using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The app runs and resembles Wordle, and simply put, it's a word-guessing game where you need to guess the correct word within 5 attempts. Not particularly a gamechanger, but I was able to put my own little spin on it. My hope is that you find it enjoyable, or at the very least, tolerable.

I have codenamed this clone **RIDDLE** due to the thematic nature of it's development.

    - it's cryptic, you'll need to think harder
    - writing and decipering my own code was hard
    - a lot of trial and error, testing new ideas and functions
    - it's (probably) RIDDLED with bugs

Naming the app itself 'RIDDLE' felt somewhat facetious and so I've titled it '2017-2021-dle', which conveniently lends to the solving of the word. Building the project was also an excellent way to test my knowledge and comprehension of what I've learnt thus far.

I learnt and applied a ton from my experience:
- some neat VS code tricks - `div#name` + enter produces `<div id=name></div>`
- how to run special animations using `keyframes` and 
- how to style transitions using `element:active`
- effectively using `let` to define variables
- math
- if statements within for...loops and alongside other if statements
- how for...in loops *actually* work
- `setTimeout()`

I struggled some with:
- poor naming conventions
- local variables, in that they don't travel 
- math (lol)
- variables with indexes

I couldn't figure out:
- how to disable a "positional" class by index within an index, if it matched with another index that had the "correct" class - I ended up changing my word solution due to this
- how to `math.random()` an array, so that the array contained an existing 5-letter word
- how to disable the delete button from moving up a row and continuing to delete already tested words
- how to write a function that checks if two arrays having exact matching strings (took the easy way out on that one by writing repetitive code)
- how to effectively employ `switch` - commented it out 

All in all, this project was super fun to build and had me up til late trying to get it all working. I recognise the importance of taking breaks because coming back to code with a fresh mind is **always fruitful**.

Any feedback will be greatly appreciated. Huge shout out to the 3K1J for their invaluable education.
